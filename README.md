# Combat Sleuth

Primary holding place / testbed for a Pathfinder 2e Monster Directory. 

The backend will be a Rust-powered API (supported by Rocket and Sea ORM).

The frontend will be a Typescript React page.

Mostly just to play around with things and continue to increase experience, but who doesn't like a toy project?
